## 🦝 Hello world!
Software developer transitioning from a background in wildlife education and business management. As lifelong learner with a diverse professional background, I thrive in collaborative environments where unique perspectives can come together to solve complex problems. I strive to continue to participate in socially responsible work through advocacy, teaching, and learning - both professionally and personally.
